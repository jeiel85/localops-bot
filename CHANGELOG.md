# Changelog

## v0.8.5 — Rounded window corners and a drop shadow

### Changed
- The tray windows now have Windows 11 rounded corners and a drop shadow (asked of DWM), so the
  custom title bar sits in a proper window frame instead of a hard-edged rectangle. Dragging and
  Aero-Snap are unchanged; on Windows 10 the corners simply stay square.

## v0.8.4 — Auto-update actually installs now

### Fixed
- "Check for Updates → Download & Install" from the tray now works. The tray runs without admin
  rights, so its update helper couldn't write to `Program Files` or restart the service and failed
  silently. It now asks for administrator approval (UAC) before applying, shows a download
  notification, brings the tray back after the update, and tells you if you decline the prompt.

> **One-time note:** this fix lives in the updater itself, so v0.8.3 and earlier can't pull it
> automatically — reinstall once with the v0.8.4 `Homebase-Setup.exe`, and in-app auto-update works
> from then on.

## v0.8.3 — Themed window title bars

### Changed
- The tray windows (dashboard, welcome, and the update dialog) now wear a custom Homebase title
  bar — a carbon caption with the app icon, the title, and themed minimize/close buttons — instead
  of the default Windows chrome, so the whole window matches the app. Dragging, Aero-Snap and the
  taskbar keep working natively via WindowChrome; the fixed-size windows show minimize + close
  (dialogs show close only).

## v0.8.2 — Consistent theming across the tray UI

### Changed
- The tray now themes the controls that were still showing as plain Windows defaults: the bot-token
  and chat-ID text fields, the notification-forwarding checkbox, the disk list text, and the
  scrollbars all follow the Homebase look now.
- The update-check prompts are a themed Homebase dialog (carbon header, signal/carbon buttons)
  instead of a bare system message box.

## v0.8.1 — Tray dashboard no longer vanishes on click

### Fixed
- Clicking the tray icon now reliably opens the dashboard and keeps it open. It used to hide itself
  the instant it lost focus — which happened immediately when opened from the tray icon, so it only
  ever flashed as an empty window and disappeared. The dashboard now stays until you close it, comes
  to the front on a tray click, and only toggles shut when it is already the active window.

## v0.8.0 — Temperature: driver-free by default, full sensors opt-in

### Changed
- Temperature monitoring now defaults to a **driver-free WMI/ACPI sensor**, so a fresh install no
  longer loads the WinRing0 kernel driver that Windows Defender flags as vulnerable
  (`VulnerableDriver:WinNT/Winring0`). Controlled by the new `temperature.source` key (`"Wmi"` by
  default). WMI exposes only coarse ACPI zone temperatures — and many desktops don't expose them at
  all — so temperatures may be blank; use the opt-in below for full sensors.
- `/diagnostics` now reports the active temperature backend and live sensor count (e.g.
  `Wmi, 0 sensors`), so an empty temperature reading is self-diagnosable.

### Added
- **Opt-in full sensors:** run `enable-temperature.ps1` as administrator to switch to
  LibreHardware (per-core CPU / GPU / board sensors). It registers a Defender exclusion for the
  driver and restarts the service; `-Disable` reverts to WMI and removes the exclusion, and
  uninstall removes it too. The script warns when Memory Integrity / the vulnerable-driver
  blocklist is active, since the driver may then be blocked from loading regardless of the
  exclusion.

## v0.7.5 — Bot replies in your language

### Added
- All bot responses are now localized, not just AI advice: command output (`/status`, `/help`,
  `/disk`, `/diagnostics`, and the rest), automatic alerts (process/service/endpoint/port down and
  recovered), the boot notification, and the active health-advice message. English is the default;
  set `agent:language` to `"ko"` for Korean, or leave it empty to follow the OS display language
  automatically.

### Changed
- `/advise` now replies in the same language as the rest of the bot: when `llmAdvisor.language` is
  empty it follows `agent:language` (or the OS display language) instead of only the OS language.

### Fixed
- The boot notification timestamp shows a literal `KST` label again instead of a mangled
  `+09:00ST` (the format string was treating `K` as a UTC-offset specifier).

## v0.7.4 — Faster advice and reply language

### Added
- Advice can reply in your language: set `llmAdvisor.language` (e.g. `"Korean"`), or leave it
  empty to follow the OS display language automatically.

### Changed
- `/advise` and automatic advice are much faster on repeat calls: the model is kept warm between
  calls (`keep_alive`) and the reply length is capped (`maxTokens`), avoiding the slow model-load
  each time (measured ~7s cold vs ~1.2s warm on `llama3.2:1b`). Both are tunable under `llmAdvisor`.

## v0.7.3 — Full Homebase rebrand (service, binaries, folders)

### Changed
- Renamed to Homebase everywhere it is visible: the install folder (`C:\Program Files\Homebase`),
  the Windows service (`Homebase.Agent`), the executables (`Homebase.Agent.exe`,
  `Homebase.Tray.exe`), the data/config folder (`C:\ProgramData\Homebase`), and the bot-token
  environment variable (`HOMEBASE_TELEGRAM_TOKEN`). Reinstall with the new setup to pick it up.

## v0.7.2 — Cleaner install folder; repo renamed to homebase

### Changed
- The installer always offers the standard default folder (`C:\Program Files\LocalOpsBot`) and no
  longer pre-fills a previously-used location, so a stale install path can't carry over.
- The project repository moved to `github.com/jeiel85/homebase`; download, one-line install, and
  auto-update links now point there (GitHub redirects the old URLs).

## v0.7.1 — Uninstall fully removes the agent

### Fixed
- Uninstalling now stops and removes the Windows service, clears the bot-token environment
  variable, and unregisters tray auto-start. The service was created outside the installer's
  file tracking, so a plain uninstall used to leave it running — and still sending alerts.

### Changed
- The service and tray now run in place from the install folder instead of being copied to a
  separate hardcoded location, so there is a single, cleanly-removable install.

## v0.7.0 — Set up Telegram from the app, not the installer

### Changed
- Setup no longer asks for your Telegram bot token and chat ID. The installer just installs the
  service and tray; you enter your credentials on first run in the Homebase welcome window and
  click **Save & apply** — a single admin prompt applies them and restarts the service. Change
  them any time from the same place.
- The Agent now starts and runs idle when no token is configured yet, instead of failing at
  startup — so a fresh install stays healthy until you finish setup in the tray.

> **Upgrade note:** reinstall once with the new `Homebase-Setup.exe` to get the in-app setup flow.
> Your existing token and chat ID are preserved; you can update them from the tray afterwards.

## v0.6.0 — Local AI Health Advice (Ollama)

### Added
- `/advise` — ask a local LLM (Ollama) for plain-language health advice about your PC's current
  state (CPU/RAM/disk/network + recent alerts), e.g. "CPU has been pegged, check for a runaway
  process". Nothing is bundled: it talks to a local Ollama server configured under `llmAdvisor`
  (endpoint/model), and falls back to a friendly setup hint when no server is reachable.
- Temperature monitoring: CPU/GPU/board sensor readings now show in `/status` and feed `/advise`,
  so an overheating component is something the advisor can actually flag. Read via
  LibreHardwareMonitor inside the Agent (the elevated service; the tray can't read sensors);
  machines that expose no sensors are handled gracefully, and implausible sentinel readings
  (e.g. a `255°C` "not ready" value) are filtered out. Set `temperature.enabled` to `false` to
  skip collection entirely — for instance if antivirus flags the kernel driver.
- Active health advice (opt-in): a background monitor watches CPU, memory, disk, and temperature,
  and when a threshold stays breached it asks the local LLM for advice and sends it to Telegram —
  so you hear about a hot or overloaded PC without running `/advise` yourself. Off by default;
  enable and tune it under `advisorAlerts` (per-metric thresholds, poll interval, a sustained-breach
  count, and a cooldown that caps how often advice is sent). Advice flows through the existing
  mute/dedup/rate-limit path, and the LLM is only called once a breach persists past the cooldown.
- Ollama setup onboarding: the Tray welcome window now checks whether the local Ollama server is
  running and whether the configured model is pulled, and guides you accordingly — a "Get Ollama"
  link when it isn't reachable, or a one-click "Run pull" for the missing model — so `/advise` and
  automatic advice are easy to turn on. Read-only and non-elevated, like the rest of onboarding.

### Changed
- Release assets are renamed to the Homebase brand: `Homebase-Setup.exe`, `Homebase-Setup.zip`,
  and `Homebase-Setup.zip.sha256` (previously `LocalOpsBot-Setup.*`). Internal names — the
  install folder, Windows service, and binaries — are unchanged.

> **Upgrade note:** the auto-updater in v0.5.1 and earlier looks for the old
> `LocalOpsBot-Setup.zip` asset, so it cannot bridge this rename. Update **once manually** by
> downloading the new `Homebase-Setup.exe`; auto-update resumes normally from then on.

## v0.5.1 — /events Fix & Event Log Failure Logging

### Fixed
- `/events` now shows the actual most-recent events. It previously shared the alert poller's
  resume bookmark, so it usually returned "No recent events" and could even hide events from
  the alert pipeline; it now reads independently, without touching poller state.

### Changed
- Windows Event Log read failures are now logged (once per failing log, plus a recovery note)
  instead of being silently swallowed.

## v0.5.0 — Event Log Bookmarks & Poll Diagnostics

### Added
- `/diagnostics` now reports the last successful Telegram poll time and the current
  consecutive-poll-failure count, so you can tell at a glance whether polling is alive.

### Changed
- Windows Event Log polling resumes from a bookmark instead of re-scanning the whole log
  every cycle — much cheaper on large logs, with identical alerting behaviour.

### Fixed
- The `/diagnostics` header now reads "Homebase" (the last stray "LocalOps" label).

## v0.4.0 — Homebase: Redesign, Onboarding & Readable Replies

### Fixed
- Command replies (`/status`, `/help`, …) no longer show raw `<b>`/`<code>` tags. The
  Telegram client now applies the configured `parse_mode` (HTML) even when the caller
  passes no options — previously only alerts/boot messages set it, so command replies
  went out unformatted.

### Added
- The tray **Settings** window is now a live dashboard: Agent service status (running /
  stopped) plus real-time uptime, CPU, RAM, network, and per-drive disk usage, refreshed
  every 3 seconds from the same collectors the bot uses.
- **First-run onboarding**: a welcome window checks connection readiness (Agent service,
  bot token, chat allowlist), sends a test Telegram message to verify end-to-end, and
  guides setup for anything missing. Shown once per user, reopenable from the tray's
  "Setup / Welcome" menu. Read-only — it never writes config, so it needs no elevation.
- **Homebase visual identity**: a Nintendo-2001 "console chrome" theme across the tray UI,
  and a proper multi-resolution app / taskbar / tray icon (replacing the runtime-drawn glyph).

### Changed
- About box shows the actual assembly version instead of a hardcoded `v1.0.0`.
- Rebranded **LocalOps Bot → Homebase** across the tray UI, installer, and docs (the
  internal service and binary names are unchanged, so existing installs upgrade cleanly).

## v0.3.0 — Streamlined Release & Hardened Updates

### Changed
- Slimmed the release to 5 clearly-named assets: `LocalOpsBot-Setup.exe` (installer),
  `LocalOpsBot-Setup.zip` (manual install), its `.sha256`, `bootstrap.ps1`, and
  `appsettings.example.json`. Removed the standalone Agent/Tray zips and duplicated
  scripts that cluttered the release page.
- Release notes now lead with a "which file do I download?" guide.
- Rewrote the README install section around the installer; corrected the runtime
  prerequisite (the build is self-contained — no separate .NET runtime needed).

### Hardened (auto-update)
- Verify the SHA-256 of every downloaded update before applying it; abort on mismatch.
- Report update download/apply failures back to the user instead of silently swallowing them.
- The apply step now logs to `update.log`, waits for the Agent to exit, verifies the new
  binary is present, and restarts the service on failure so a botched update never leaves
  the monitor down. Both Agent and Tray are updated (previously the Tray was missed).
- Pin auto-update to the `LocalOpsBot-Setup.zip` asset instead of "the first .zip".
- Stamp the version from the git tag at build time so update checks compare correctly.

### Added
- Unit tests for the updater (asset selection + checksum verification).

## v0.2.0 — Runnable + Automatic Alerts

### Fixed (runnability)
- Fix DI circular dependency (Help command) that crashed the Agent on startup
- Register missing `IHostInfoProvider`; gate toast-forwarding services behind config
- Load config from ProgramData/executable folder + `LOCALOPSBOT__` environment variables
- Resolve `ENV:` token indirection in the Telegram client
- Align `setup.ps1` config schema with the code; unify the Windows service name
- Initialize Serilog file logging (was referenced but never wired up)

### Added
- Automatic alerts for process / service / event-log / HTTP / TCP-port issues, with recovery notifications
- `AlertDispatcher` as the common alert path, wiring mute / dedup / rate-limit policy
- `/diagnostics`, `/http`, `/llm` commands

### Hardened
- De-duplicate event-log config arrays; make monitor intervals config-driven (`collectors`)
- Baseline the event-log first poll to prevent alert storms on restart
- Actually drop block-listed toast notifications (Tray drop + Agent double-check)
